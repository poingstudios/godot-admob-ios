This repository is for a _Godot Engine Plugin_ that allows showing the ads offered by **AdMob** in an **easy** way, without worrying about the building or version, **just download and use**.

The **purpose** of this plugin is to always keep **up to date with Godot**, supporting **ALMOST ALL** versions from v4.1+, and also make the code **compatible** on **[Android](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-android) and iOS**, so each advertisement will work **identically on both systems**.

### 🔑 Key features

- It's a wrapper for [Google Mobile Ads SDK](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/download). 🎁
- Easy Configuration. 😀
- Supports nearly all Ad Formats: **Banner**, **Interstitial**, **Rewarded**, **Rewarded Interstitial**. 📺
- GDPR Compliance with UMP Support. ✉️
- Targeting Capabilities. 🎯
- Seamless integration with Mediation partners: **Meta**, **Vungle**. 💰
- CI/CD for streamlined development and deployment. 🔄🚀
- Features a dedicated [Godot Plugin](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-plugin), reducing the need for extensive coding. 🔌
- There is also an [Android Plugin](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-android) available, which has the same behavior. 🤖

## 🙋‍♂️How to use 
- We recommend you to use the [AdMob Plugin](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-plugin), you can download direcly from [Godot Assets](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/2063).
- After download, we recommend you to read the [README.md](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-plugin/blob/master/README.md) of the Plugin to know how to use.

## 📦Installing:

### 📥Download
- To get started, download the `poing-godot-admob-ios-v{{ your_godot_version }}.zip` file from the [releases tab](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-ios/releases). We recommend checking the [supported Godot version](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-versions/blob/master/versions.json) before proceeding. You can also use the [AdMob Plugin](https://github.com/PoingStudios/godot-admob-plugin) for this step by navigating to `Tools -> AdMob Download Manager -> iOS -> LatestVersion`.


### 🧑‍💻Usage
- Video tutorial: https://youtu.be/TB7WhP8mieo
- Inside `poing-godot-admob-ios-v{{ your_godot_version }}.zip` you downloaded, you will face some folders like `'ads'`, `'meta'`, `'vungle'`. To AdMob works only `'ads'` is required, but if you want [Mediation](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/13420272?hl=en), you need the other folders.
- Move the content inside the folder which you need into ```res://ios/plugins``` directory on your Godot project.
- Update the configuration in ```res://ios/plugins/poing-godot-admob-ads.gdip```. The `GADApplicationIdentifier` is required to change when release your game.
- If you are using Mediation: On `SKAdNetworkItems` in `.gdip` file, you can remove the comments of the [Mediations Networks](https://developers.google.com/admob/ios/choose-networks) which you are using.
- Export the project enabling the `Ad Mob`, if you have Mediation, also mark `Ad Mob Meta`, etc...

### 💻Xcode preparation
- Go to `{{ ios_xcode_export_folder }}/{{your_project_name}}/ios/plugins/poing-godot-admob/scripts/` folder and open the terminal (must be inside this folder).
- Run the commands: 
```bash
chmod +x update_and_install.sh
./update_and_install.sh
```
- This will create for your a `{{ your_project_name }}.xcworkspace` file on your `{{ ios_xcode_export_folder }}`, open this file.
- Go to the Target of your Application and them `General -> Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content` and add all `Pods` in section.
- Run the Game.
- [If you are trying to run on Simulator and is not working read this](https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/44681#issuecomment-751399783).
